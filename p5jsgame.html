<h1>P5js (game)</h1>
<p>The player goes through every stanza of "Sisyphus and the Ants" By contemporary poet Jennifer S. Flescher, broken up into unpredictably long periods of 'silence' between line changes. The win conditions get higher and higher, until they reach a frustratingly high barrier at the end. If someone is bored or stubborn enough to reach it, there IS a win condition, but it will require extreme devotion/patience. Every line is further away, and the player must strain to achieve closure.
