<h1>Genius Bar Help Page: Apple(TM) Urgent Care for Shrapnel</h1>
<p>Elevate the injury as best you can, assessing for the depth of the wound and the size of the shrapnel. If you can see yellow fatty tissue or bone, OR if the wound exceeds a quarter inch in depth, drive to the nearest Apple Store for the first six stitches and a complimentary coconut-scented wound wash.</p>
<p></p>
<p> As part of the terms and conditions of using our products, you have forefitted legal action in favor of Apple(TM) Medical assistance. If your shrapnel injury needs more than six stitches, you may consider updating your Apple Plan for further assistance not covered by your product warranty.</p>
