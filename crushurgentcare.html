<h1>Genius Bar Help Page: Apple(TM) Urgent Care for Crushing</h1>
<p>You have selected the Urgent Care page for rocks and rock-related injuries. It would appear that you heard a "crunch" within your hand when trying to liberate yourself from the horrible machine on your desk which pitilessly mocks you, even now! We are so sorry to hear that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elevate the injury as best you can, and wiggle your fingers. If you can see yellow fatty tissue or bone, OR if the wound exceeds a quarter inch in depth, drive to the nearest Apple Store for the first six stitches and a complimentary fruit punch scented saline spray. You are also eligible for splint or cast rental for the next two weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p> As part of the terms and conditions of using our products, you have forefitted legal action in favor of Apple(TM) Medical assistance. If your rock-related injury needs more than six stitches, or more than two weeks in a cast or splint, you may consider updating your Apple Plan for further assistance not covered by your product warranty.</p>
