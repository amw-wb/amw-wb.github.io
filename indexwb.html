<h1>Autumn White, Illustrator</h1>
<p>Autumn White is a freelance illustrator, clothing designer, and CRM Archaeologist. Their display history spans 6 years of group shows, individual exhibitions, and ceramics conferences. They recently presented original archaeological research at the SCA Conference in Riverside, CA, and continue to make art concerning the dig site and write academic papers on the material culture of childhood and bereavement.</p>
<p></p>
Their current printing project is transferring photography and illustrations of historic graves and artifacts to wearable, vintage clothing items, for the community to enjoy. They hope that this will spark interest in our collective past.
<p></p>
<p>They are also working on a 6ftx5ft triptych oil painting of water nymphs ripping apart men and fish between their sharp teeth. It is set to be displayed in February of 2025.</p>
