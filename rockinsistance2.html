<h1>Genius Bar Help Page: Current Rock Insistance</h1>
<p>You are very committed to this rock. While your brand loyalty is deeply impressive, your rock is not up to the task of computer smashing.</p>

<p> <a href="hermeticsolitude.html">This rock is my only worldly posession. I live far away from the evils of capitalistic society and spend all of my time in silent, monastic contemplation of the earth and all its creatures</a> </p>
<p> <a href="rockbond.html">I am concerned that my rock's feelings will be hurt if I use a different rock for smashing computers</a> </p>
<p> <a href="rockinsistance3.html">You are a detestible little wench. This rock IS sufficient. YOU are insufficient. I need to smash the computer with THIS ROCK.</a> </p>
