<h1>Glitched Image Project</h1>
<p> Through translating the image into text and modifying it, or transferring it into audio and distorting it, theses files were corrupted. The series of longnose lancet-fish were 'glitched' to honor a formative childhood experience of trying and failing to befriend them in Endless Ocean, a game for the nintendo Wii. I was an undiagnosed autistic child who played the game for hours, happily stimming by shaking the wii mote and engaging with animals I had hyper-fixated on. The whalefall environment was especially calming to me. I had logged hundreds of hours on Endless Ocean when I eventually encountered a longnose lancetfish I could not befriend. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I took this glitch very personally-- as if I had finally failed to socialize correctly there, too. This was even more upsetting because I had always felt a profound kinship with 'ugly' or 'unlovable' animals; I felt they were misunderstood, as I felt I was, and that they only needed patience to become lovable. My efforts with the lancetfish failed, after months of frustratedly crying and trying to befriend it. I turned off the game, too upset to revisit it, until earlier this year.  I started a new file and did not encounter the same glitch.</p>
