<h1>P5js (Drawing Program)</h1>
<p>This project uses transparent png images sourced from scanned personal textbooks and creative-commons licensed images online. Each image is representative of an OCD trigger; parasites, images fromm pathology textbooks that become intrusive overlays in my day to day life, symbols of sin, disease, home intruders, and danger. The drawing programm they form is meant to estrange the symbol/trigger from its anxiety-inducing context, using them to draw rather than hyperfocusing on the reflexive anxiety they inspire.

<p>I've seen a lot of people online in recent years misinterpret what OCD is. They scoff at 'unusual' triggers, they insist that cleaning is the only manifestation of a compulsion, they joke about how we're all "a little ocd" because they straighten the pens on their desk. This is infuriating. I hope this allows them to see the world closer to the way I see it, because the lack of empathy people exhibit towards the private, life-destroying terror OCD inspires is genuinely disturbing.</p>
