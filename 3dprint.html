<p>I modeled a 3-D version of a historic deathhead headstone. Death heads were a particularly rich source of religious symbolsim in historic New England graves; the fact that the carvings are easily serialized by the birth and death dates of the interred individual also makes them especially useful to archaeologists. Examining these graves in sequence allows us to visually pattern shifting ideas about death, bereavement, and the afterlife in early American communities.

The headstone was sculpted in survival mode; as such, I repeatedly fell to my death while sculpting it. As frustrating as that experience was, it did undeniably make the end result a little funnier.
