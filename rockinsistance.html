<h1>Genius Bar Help Page: Your Rock Is Out of Date</h1>
<p>It would seem that your current rock is out of date or incompatible with ending your current operating system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having evaluated the fitness of your rock as a blunt force weapon, it would seem that the rock method will not resolve the error. You may benefit from an alternative solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many household items can be used to resolve these little bugs! Take a look around your home, keeping an eye out for hammers, heavy boots, meat tenderizers, canisters of liquid (especially gasoline!), or decorative sculptures.</p>
